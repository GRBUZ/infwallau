    <h1>üìã Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 2025</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Influencers Wall</strong>. By purchasing pixels and placing content on our grid, you agree to these Terms of Use. Please read them carefully.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Purchases & Pricing</h2>
    
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Starting Price</h3>
      <p>The initial price of 1 pixel is <strong>USD $1.00</strong>.</p>
      
      <h3>Price Increase</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pixels are sold in blocks of <strong>10√ó10 (100 pixels)</strong> which is the minimum purchase unit</li>
        <li>The price increases progressively: for every <strong>1,000 pixels sold</strong> across the entire grid, the unit price increases by <strong>$0.01</strong></li>
        <li>This means the price rises as the grid fills up, regardless of individual purchase sizes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Price at Time of Reservation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When you select pixels, the current unit price is displayed</li>
        <li>This price is guaranteed only once you complete the reservation process and proceed to payment</li>
        <li>If your reservation expires or is canceled, you must reselect your pixels, and the price will be recalculated based on the current price level</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Final Price Calculation</h3>
      <p>The total price of your selection is calculated progressively as the grid fills up.</p>
      
      <div class="pricing-example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        ‚Ä¢ First 1,000 pixels: $1.00/px<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Next 1,000 pixels: $1.01/px<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Next 1,000 pixels: $1.02/px<br>
        ‚Ä¢ And so on...
      </div>
      
      <p>If your purchase spans multiple price levels (e.g., crossing the 1,000 pixel threshold), each portion will be priced according to the current rate at that moment.</p>
      <h3>Additional Terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> All prices are displayed and payable in U.S. dollars (USD)</li>
        <li><strong>Indicative Prices:</strong> Any price shown during selection is indicative. The final payable price is confirmed at checkout</li>
        <li><strong>No Retroactive Adjustments:</strong> Once pixels are purchased, the price is final. Later price changes do not affect prior purchases</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Payment:</strong> All payments are processed securely via <span class="pill">PayPal</span></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
